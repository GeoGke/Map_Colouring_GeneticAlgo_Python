# Map-colouring problem explanation - Under Construction
The code implements a solution to an (NP-complete) Map colouring problem (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_coloring) by using Genetic Algorithms. 
The default map for the software is given below, but also there is a choice to create a different map.

The Genetic Algorithm has the characteristics below: 
1) Maximum number of generations = 100 
2) Roulette wheel selection is used for the selection of the parents (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitness_proportionate_selection) 
3) The offspring is generated by using Single Point Crossover (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossover_(genetic_algorithm)). In this case, the middle point is always the crossover point
4) There is mutation to 10% of the total population 

Performance related updates will be conducted in the future!!!
